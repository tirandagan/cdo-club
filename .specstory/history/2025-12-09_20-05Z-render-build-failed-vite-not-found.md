The user is getting a build failure on render.com. The error is:

```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

This happens when running `npm run build` which executes `vite build`.

The issue is that vite is not installed. This typically happens when:
1. Dependencies haven't been installed (no `npm install` was run)
2. Vite is a dev</details></think>
