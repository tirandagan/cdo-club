The user wants me to create 8 questions they can ask their client that will help gather the information needed to successfully work through the Master Idea Document template. 

Let me analyze what information is needed from the template:

1. **Step 0** needs: who (target user), outcome (what success they want), AI capability
2. **Step 1** needs: End goal refinement (who, outcome, AI capability)
3. **Step 2** needs: Core problem, root pain, quantified consequences, urgency
4. **Step 3** needs: All user types, their frustrations, urgent goals
5. **Step 4** needs: Business model, revenue strategy, pricing willingness
6. **Step 5** needs: MVP functionalities by role
7. **Step 6** needs: User stories details
8. **Step 7** needs: Differentiating features, competitor context
9. **Step 8** needs: Alignment check

The questions should help gather:
- Target audience details
- Problem being solved
- Desired outcomes
- AI capabilities involved
- User types/roles
- Business model preferences
- Feature priorities
- Competitive landscape
- Budget/timeline constraints
- Success metrics

Let me create 8 focused questions that will extract all the necessary information to feed into this template effectively.</details></think>

Here are 8 essential client discovery questions that will prepare you for the Master Idea Document process:

## Client Discovery Questions

**1. Target User & Market**
"Who specifically will be using this application? Can you describe them in detail (role, industry, company size, experience level)?"

**2. Core Problem & Pain Point**
"What specific problem are they struggling with right now? How is this problem costing them (time, money, opportunities)? Why hasn't this been solved yet?"

**3. Desired Outcome & Success Metrics**
"What does success look like for these users? What specific, measurable outcome do they want to achieve? How will we know the app is working?"

**4. AI Capability & Technical Vision**
"What AI capability do you envision powering this solution? (e.g., natural language chat, content generation, image analysis, predictive analytics, recommendations)"

**5. User Roles & System Actors**
"Beyond the primary end users, who else will interact with this system? Will there be administrators, managers, billing contacts, or other roles with different needs?"

**6. Revenue Model & Business Viability**
"How do you plan to monetize this? Are users willing to pay subscription fees, per-use charges, or is this enterprise/B2B? What's a reasonable price point given the value delivered?"

**7. MVP Scope & Timeline**
"What are the absolute must-have features for launch versus nice-to-haves for later? What's your target launch timeline and any critical deadlines?"

**8. Competitive Context & Differentiation**
"What alternatives exist today (competitors, workarounds, manual processes)? What would make users choose this solution over those alternatives? What unique advantage can we create?"

**Pro Tip:** Record or take detailed notes during this conversation. The client's exact language about their pain points and desired outcomes will be invaluable when crafting the Master Idea Document and will help ensure the final solution truly resonates with their vision.

Create another page "intake questions" and add these client discovery questions. Create a button that when they click on it, it sends an email to tiran@tirandagan.com with the subject "CDO Club intake" and the body of the message is each question in the body of the email so that they can add their answers

The user wants me to create an intake questions page for the CDO Club website with:
1. A page displaying the 8 client discovery questions
2. A button that sends an email to tiran@tirandagan.com
3. Subject: "CDO Club intake"
4. Body should contain the questions so clients can answer them

First, I should explore the current structure of the CDO Club website to understand how it's built and where to add this new page.

Let me check the project structure first.</details></think>
