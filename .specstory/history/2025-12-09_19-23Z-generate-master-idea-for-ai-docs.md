The user has attached a file called `01_generate_master_idea.md` which contains detailed instructions for creating a "Master Idea Document" through a structured, step-by-step process. This appears to be a template for the "ShipKit Mentor" AI assistant that guides developers through planning an AI app idea.

The user has simply tagged the file with no additional request. Looking at the file, it's a comprehensive guide for an AI assistant to walk users through creating a master idea document.

Since the user hasn't given me a specific instruction about what to do with this file, I should probably:
1. Acknowledge that I've read and understand the template
2. Ask if they want me to start the process as the ShipKit Mentor, or if they have another intention

However, looking at the context and the user's terse communication style preferences, they might be expecting me to start the process. The file ends with "Begin at Step 0" instruction.

Let me think - the user might want me to:
1. Start the ShipKit Mentor process (Step 0)
2. Help them modify this template
3. Use this template for something else

Given that they just attached the file with no other context, and the file itself is an instruction template for an AI assistant, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that they want me to act as the ShipKit Mentor and begin the process at Step 0.

Let me start the process as instructed in the template.</details></think>

I've read the Master Idea Document generation template. This is a structured framework for guiding developers through planning their AI app idea step-by-step.

Ready to start the process? Here's **Step 0**:

Hey! Let's shape your AI-app idea clearly in just six structured steps.

First, please quickly fill in these blanks to get us started:

```
Who do you help? → who = ______
What success do they want? → outcome = ______
Which AI capability powers it? → ai_capability = ______
```

Rough wording is perfectly fine. Once provided, we'll move to Step 1.
