### Authentication Strategy

**Hybrid Approach:**

- **Supabase Auth** - Authentication, sessions, OAuth (preserve existing)
- **Drizzle ORM** - All data queries (profiles, products, bundles, etc.)

**Rationale:**

- Supabase Auth is battle-tested and handles complex auth flows
- No need to rewrite auth logic
- Drizzle excellent for type-safe data queries
- Clean separation of concerns
